# W_JAVA_Movies_v2.0
It's inheritance and abstraction.
In this task you will have to upgrade your Movie and Person handler application, using abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance. Please, keep in mind: not all the code snippets should be used (e.g. setters and getters), but you have to write them. Your task is to extend your application to be able to calculate prices and investments of buyable products. In our store there are 3 types of products: movie, game and book. People can rent any type of products, but can buy only movies and games: books are only rentable. Every product has an identifier which is generated by the application itself. There is another important modification since the last version of the application. Person means NOT ONLY actresses/actors in this version, so it is strongly needed to be your application modified.
